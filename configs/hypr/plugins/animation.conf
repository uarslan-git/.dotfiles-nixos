# === FORMAT OR AN ANIMATION ===
# animation = NAME, ONOFF, SPEED, CURVE [,STYLE]
# "ONOFF" use 0 to disable, 1 to enable. Note: if it’s 0, you can omit further args.
# "SPEED" is the amount of ds (1ds = 100ms) the animation will take.
# "CURVE is the bezier curve name, see curves 
# (https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Animations/#curves)
# "STYLE" (optional) is the animation style.
# The animations are a tree. If an animation is unset, it will inherit its parent’s values. See the animations tree.
